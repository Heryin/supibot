  "So you're going by \"Max\" now nerd? Haha whats up douche bag, it's Lewis from Mercedes. Remember me? Me and the team used to give you a hard time in the race. Sorry you were just an easy target lol. I can see not much has changed. Remember Masi the guy who kept penalising you? Yeah he's in my pocket now now. I make over 1 championship a year and drive a championship winning car. I guess some things never change huh loser? Nice catching up lol. Pathetic... ",
  "H-hey Verstappen, do you remember me from Saudi Arabia? 2021? It's Masi. I just wanted to stop by since you missed the last drivers meeting, I was looking for you.

Anyway, I hope you're doing well...HAHA Just kidding, it's still Lewis you fucking gullible idiot lmfao. Anyway, the championship awaits, see ya man good talk.",

  "Question for you to both: Is Formula 1 driving today too complicated with 20 and more buttons on the wheel are you too much under effort under pressure? What are your wishes for the future concerning technical program, errrm, during the race? Less buttons more? Or less and more comunication with your engineers?",
  "Yikes, stick to F1 mate. The yearly TI tweet I presume? Don't need clueless pretenders acting as if they know shit about TI. Pretty embarrassing to be honest. It's obvious you have no idea who these people are.",
  "Dear Hamilton fans, Goodbye. As an honest unbiased Hamilton fan since 2007, I have finally opened my eyes and realised just how small and insignificant he really is. So that's why I've decided to support Verstappen, a great driver. Time to finally win some real trophies.",
